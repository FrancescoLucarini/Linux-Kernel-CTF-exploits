# Linux-Kernel-CTF-exploits
Consider this repository as a replacement for blog posts, because of university I don't have too much time to write what I would like and how I would like it.
All the exploits will be commented so as to be a substitute, even if in part, for the blogs, and maybe if I find some challenges that are really difficult or with techniques that are new to me I might consider writing a blog about it
